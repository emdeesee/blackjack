I'd like to map out the course of the initial game, given that we'll
be using text.

# BLACKJACK #

### Hitting ###

When the user hits:
* Get a card for the deck.
* Check if I busted.
* If I DIDN'T bust, then the dealer has to calculate what he does. If he has 17 or under, he absolutely has to hit. If not, he should always stay... I think.
* Go back to beginning of the turn.

### Staying ###

* Is it true that if both people stay, they reveal their cards?
* If I stay, same thing happens as with the non-busting situation. Other player has to hit.
